# Tokens
Hands-on lab on creating, deploying and working with Ethereum EIP20 (a.k.a ERC20) Token.

## Deploy ERC20 Token
To begin with, you will deploy all the required contracts including ```MYToken``` ERC20 contract.

* Open the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and create a new file. Name it ```AllinOne.sol```. 
* Copy the content of [AllinOne.sol](https://github.com/razi-rais/blockchain-workshop/blob/master/tokens/AllInOne.sol) file and paste it into contract file you have created in the previous step. 

  Note: You can also use truffle but steps are not provided in this document.
